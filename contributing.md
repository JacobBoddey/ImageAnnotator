3.	Set the label to “Bug”

## New Features
Requests for new features are welcomed but should be done so following this process and these requirements:
1.	Create an issue at https://olympuss.ntu.ac.uk/sdi-21/ImageAnnotator/issues
2.	Set the label to “Feature Request”  

Feature requests should:
* Have a clear and concise title
* Have a very detailed description to clearly describes the new feature fully
* Include any documents or images to explain/demonstrate the new feature or to demonstrate new user interface designs

## Implementing New Features
In order to implement new features from an issue request, you should:
1. Create a new branch (named in line with the name of the issue request)
2. Commit changes to that branch - and only changes relevant to the issue request
3. Create a pull request from the new branch to the master branch.

All commits should follow the coding style guide

The software developer will then review the pull request and action it appropriately.
